# Incident Report

**Date and Time:** 2024-08-25 14:18:26 (UTC)

**Incident ID:** INC-20240825-002

**Reported By:** Prasad badhe

**Severity Level:** High

**Status:** Resolved

## Incident Description

At 14:18 UTC, the monitoring system alerted a critical issue with the data pipeline. Data ingestion was halted, leading to delays in data processing and availability.

## Impact

- Approximately 1000 data records were delayed.
- Data availability for business users and clients was impacted.
- Data processing jobs experienced significant delays.

### **Collaboration & Stakeholders Involved**

- **Teams Involved:** ETL Team, Database Administrators, IT Operations
- **Stakeholders:** Business Analysts, Data Engineers, IT Management

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was traced to a failure in one of the data ingestion jobs due to a corrupted data file. This caused the entire pipeline to halt.

## Resolution

1. Identified the corrupted data file and removed it from the ingestion queue.
2. Restarted the affected data ingestion job.
3. Monitored the pipeline to ensure data processing resumed normally.

### **Key Metrics**

- **MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve):** 42 minutes
- **Incidents Resolved:** 1 critical issue, prevented potential downstream failures
- **System Uptime Restored:** 100%

## Preventive Measures

- Implemented additional validation checks to detect and skip corrupted data files automatically.
- Enhanced monitoring alerts to provide more detailed information about data ingestion job failures.
- Scheduled regular reviews of data ingestion processes to identify potential improvements.

## Timeline

- **14:18 UTC:** Alert received regarding data pipeline failure.
- **14:20 UTC:** Initial investigation began.
- **14:30 UTC:** Identified the issue as a corrupted data file in the ingestion job.
- **14:40 UTC:** Removed the corrupted data file from the ingestion queue.
- **14:50 UTC:** Restarted the data ingestion job.
- **15:00 UTC:** Confirmed issue resolution and monitored for stability.
- **15:30 UTC:** Incident closed.

## Lessons Learned

- Implementing validation checks can prevent similar issues in the future.
- Enhanced monitoring alerts can provide more detailed information for quicker issue resolution.
